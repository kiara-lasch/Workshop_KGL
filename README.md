# Physical Solution Space (PSS) Model
The Physical SOlution SPace (PSS) model calculates which adaptation measures are physically feaisble for implemententation in deltas, based on the unique physical characteristics of the deltas. This code runs for a global dataset of 769 deltas, but a sample dataset containing 30 deltas is provided here.

## Dependencies 
- Python v3.12.4

### Packages 
- pandas
